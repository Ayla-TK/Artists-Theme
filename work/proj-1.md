Philadelphia is in the top 10 among large cities for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). Adolescents are disproportionately affected. In response, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, STD Control Program launched a sexual health website for teens, TakeControlPhilly.org. One of the services of the website was to allow teens to mail-order condoms for free.  

The STD Control Program was looking for a way to increase the number of mail-order condoms ordered by Philadelphia youth (ages 13-19).
I created a targeted online ad campaign using Facebook advertisements.  

Facebook ads were successful in linking Philadelphia youth to the Facebook page and subsequently to mail-order condoms.Website traffic increased from a daily average of 56 to 156 visits. The daily-average condom mail orders increased from 8 orders to 39 orders per day.  The 13-17 age group increased from 5.7% to 60% of the Facebook fan base.

The results of this project were presented several times and different conferences, including the CDC STD Conference and the CDC Health Communications Conference. It was concluded that Facebook ads are a successful and cost-effective way to reach youth and persuade them to take health actions.
