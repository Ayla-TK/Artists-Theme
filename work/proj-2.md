title: Giving life to a Product
---

When I got to Einstein, it already had a great logo and a name that said a lot.  But their marketing materials weren't really expressing what the product was about. The product, a science education tool and platform, was meant to inspire kids to learn and experiment with the world around them.  

My first step was to sit down with the team and have a brainstorm session on all the words they associated with the product and the types of things they wanted customers to feel when they saw the product.  Then I took all the notes from our discussion, outlined the platform and its corresponding emotional attributes.

Their catalog and website was more product-focused at the time, and less people-focused. I took the product and borrowed some of the staff's kids to do some fun photoshoots.  Through imagery, video and messaging we were able to capture the essence of the product and bring it to life.
