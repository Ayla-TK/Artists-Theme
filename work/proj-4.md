The reality is websites get stale and every couple years you may have to do a design upgrade.  The folks at the Philly Health Department asked me to give their website a make over. They were looking for a clean and hip look while also focusing on their main objectives.  I worked on the logo and web design, photography, video, and messaging to create a better vibe and flow.
